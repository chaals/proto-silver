    <h1>Video:</h1>
    <h2>Problems:</h2>
    <p>Some users cannot hear the dialogue or sound effects clearly or at all. </p>
    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>Provide an alternative for the dialogue and sound effects</p>
    <h2>Who does it impact:</h2>
    <p>This affects people with hearing loss or deafness. It also happens to
      people in a noisy place where it is hard to hear, or a quiet pace where
      you cannot turn up the sound.</p>
    <h2>How does it impact them?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>This makes it hard to understand. </li>
      <li>It also makes it hard to focus and engage.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ways to solve the problem:</h2>
    <p>Provide the dialogue and describe the sound effects in text, sign
      language or the pictures.</p>
    <details open="">
      <summary>
        <h3>Provide text that shows what is being said.</h3>
      </summary>
      <p>Captions are text that appears on the screen, providing the text of
        what is being said. They can also provide a text version of sound
        effects. They enable people to read the dialogue instead of listening.</p>
      <p>Most video players have built-in captioning systems. The video needs to
        have captions@@. </p>

        <p> (Move this to another page) </p>
        <h4> Writing HTML </h4>
        <p>The captions can be linked to the video using the HTML <code>video </code>and
          <code>source </code>elements.</p>
        <pre>&lt;video src="fancyVid.mp4"&gt;
  &lt;track src="captions.vtt" kind="captions"&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;</pre>

        <p> move this to another page - and illustrate it </p>
        <h4> Using A third-party tool like Youtube to manage videos </h4>
        <p>For a youtube video, captions be provided as a ... file when the
          video is uploaded. Ther is also an automatic captioning feature - but
          the quality is not always good.</p>
      </section>
      <p>This will not help people who cannot read fast enough to keep up,
        unless they can slow down or pause the video.</p>
      <p>Captions can be hard to read, if they are on the picture and do not
        stand out clearly enough.</p>
      <p>Captions on the screen cannot be read by people who cannot see clearly.
        Caption formats that can be presented as text can still be made
        available, e.g. through braille or through some other interface.</p>
      <p>Reading captions can distract people from seeing the video. Then they
        may miss important parts.</p>
    </details>
    <details open="">
      <summary>
        <h3>Provide sign language interpretation of what is being said.</h3>
      </summary>
      <p>Sign language videos can be played alongside, or inside, a video</p>
    </details>
    <details open="">
      <summary>
        <h3>Show in the pictures what is being said.</h3>
      </summary>
      <p>Make sure you don't need sound to understand the video.</p>

        <h3>Show things that sound effects communicate.</h3>
        <h2>Testing if the problem is solved</h2>
        <p>Can the user use the alternative provided?</p>
        <p>To test the solution:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Turn off your sound and watch the video. Do you understand it?</dt>
          <dd>Do you understand it? If you do, you're done. Otherwise...</dd>
          <dt>Can you turn on captions and watch the video?</dt>
          <dd>Do you understand it now? If so, you're done. Otherwise</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>To test the solution</p>
        <p><br>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>If you can understand the video with the sound turned off, it
            passes.</li>
          <li>If not, can you turn on the captions and watch the video? If you
            understand it with captions turned on:
            <ul>
              <li>Your captions pass. You will still need to test whether they
                cause other problems (contrast is poor, distracting, ...)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </summary>
    </details>
    <h2>Issues under discussion:</h2>
    <h3>Is it always necessary to caption sound?</h3>
    <p>For example, where there is a background of birds singing, in a video of
      a nature scene, are captions necessary or not?</p>
